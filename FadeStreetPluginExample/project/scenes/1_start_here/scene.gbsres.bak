It handles the initial fade-in of all the elements in the scene.\n\nFour actors also have On Update scripts, which animate different parts of the scene. They're running at the same time, which is OK because they update different palettes.\n\n[Different palettes here means \"not the same four-colour background palette or 3-colour sprite palette\". So if one event updates background palette 1, and another updates background palette 2, that's OK. Two events both trying to update background palette 1  would lead to problems.]\n\nThe actor On Update scripts loop. Each script has a fixed number of iterations that it runs for (counted in a variable). When it reaches that number, the script fades out the palettes it is controlling and stops.\n\nThe four scripts are timed so that they all roughly fade out around the same time, before changing to the next scene.\n\nThat's an OK way to do things, and it works for this scene. In later scenes, you will see how you can sometimes use one script to run several effects, which means we don't need multiple actors, and we don't need to worry about syncing the timings up.",
